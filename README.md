As of 5/3/23, this is the only active fork of LRC. At this point, I believe the original repository is dead. And although the controversy involved with the creator of the original repository was large and using the original repository is looked down on in the sandbox community, I still think it is a promising project with a lot of aspects to be continued.

# Contributing
Contributions are greatly appreciated, and I have no guidelines for contribution either. You can add backend code, frontend improvements, hell, I'll accept your PR if you fix a spelling mistake. More work off of my back.
