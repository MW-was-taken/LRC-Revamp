<hr>
As of 5/3/23, this is the only active fork of LRC. At this point, I believe the original repository is dead. And although the controversy involved with the creator of the original repository was large and using the original repository is looked down on in the sandbox community, I still think it is a promising project with a lot of aspects to be continued.
